    <p> Jojo Moyes (born 4 August 1969) is an English journalist and, since 2002, a romance novelist and screenwriter.

With one child, another baby on the way, and a career as a journalist, Moyes committed to herself that if her fourth book was rejected, she would stop her efforts. After submitting the first three chapters of her fourth book to various publishers, six of them began a bidding war for the rights. She is one of only a few authors to have twice won the Romantic Novel of the Year Award by the Romantic Novelists' Association and has been translated into twenty-eight languages.You can also visit her webiste at https://www.jojomoyes.com/ </p>
